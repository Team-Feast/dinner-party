# Feast
Feast is a mobile first app that takes the chore out of planning, organizing & inviting guests to your dinner event. Our platform is designed to be mobile friendly with a focus on easy user experience. It supports seamless integration with google calendar, maps, email notifications and photo galleries. Users also have the ability to choose what to contribute to the dinner as well.
